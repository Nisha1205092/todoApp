This is a basic todo app with raw HTML and a basic backend. 
- Raw HTML is used to learn about DOM manipulation to learn about pre-React era!
- We have removed unnecessary API calls  
- todoServerWithFiles.js uses files for storage
- todoServer.js uses MongoDB for storage
- if you want to run locally, 
- inside 'index.html' change the string 
- from 'https://vercel-todo-backend-nisha1205092.vercel.app'
- to 'http://localhost:3000'
- to deploy on vercel
